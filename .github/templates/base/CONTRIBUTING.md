# Contributing to [Project Name]

First off, thank you for considering contributing to [Project Name]. It's people like you that make [Project Name] such a great tool.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make sure to check our Issues page to see if someone else in the community has already created a ticket. If not, go ahead and make one!

## Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then fork the repository and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #325 is the ticket you're working on):

`325-add-japanese-translations`

## Get the test suite running

Make sure you're using the latest version of Node.js and npm. Then, run:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm test`

## Implement your fix or feature

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first.

## Get the style right

Your patch should follow the same conventions & pass the same code quality checks as the rest of the project. Run `npm run lint` to check your code style.

## Make a Pull Request

At this point, you should switch back to your master branch and make sure it's up to date with the latest changes. Then update your feature branch from your local copy of master, and push it!

Finally, go to GitHub and make a Pull Request.

## Keeping your Pull Request updated

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

To learn more about rebasing in Git, there are a lot of good resources available online.

Thank you for contributing!
