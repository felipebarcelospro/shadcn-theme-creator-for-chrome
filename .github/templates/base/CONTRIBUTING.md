## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

**Before Submitting A Bug Report**

- Check the documentation for a list of common questions and problems.
- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/username/project/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one.

**How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?**

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue and provide the following information:

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.
- Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
- Include screenshots and animated GIFs which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

**Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion**

- Check if there's already [a package](https://www.npmjs.com/) which provides that enhancement.
- Determine which repository the enhancement should be suggested in.
- Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/search?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3Ausername) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

**How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?**

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue and provide the following information:

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.
- Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most users.
- List some other text editors or applications where this enhancement exists.
- Specify which version of the project you're using.
- Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain the project's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible solution
- Enable a sustainable system for the project's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Follow the [style guidelines](#style-guidelines)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Style Guidelines

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### JavaScript Style Guide

All JavaScript must adhere to [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/).

### Documentation Style Guide

- Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests.

[GitHub search](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) makes it easy to use labels for finding groups of issues or pull requests you're interested in.

Please open an issue if you have suggestions for new labels.

#### Type of Issue and Issue State

- `enhancement`: Feature requests.
- `bug`: Confirmed bugs or reports that are very likely to be bugs.
- `question`: Questions more than bug reports or feature requests (e.g. how do I do X).
- `feedback`: General feedback more than bug reports or feature requests.
- `help-wanted`: The project core team would appreciate help from the community in resolving these issues.
- `beginner`: Less complex issues which would be good first issues to work on for users who want to contribute to the project.
- `more-information-needed`: More information needs to be collected about these problems or feature requests (e.g. steps to reproduce).
- `needs-reproduction`: Likely bugs, but haven't been reliably reproduced.
- `blocked`: Issues blocked on other issues.
- `duplicate`: Issues which are duplicates of other issues, i.e. they have been reported before.
- `wontfix`: The project core team has decided not to fix these issues for now, either because they're working as intended or for some other reason.
- `invalid`: Issues which aren't valid (e.g. user errors).
